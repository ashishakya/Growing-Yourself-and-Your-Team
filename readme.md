# Scrum Master Fundamentals - Growing Yourself and Your Team (Coach: JEREMY JARRELL)

## 1. Coaching Your Team
### 1.1 Building a platform for successful coaching
Most important responsibilities of Scrum Master role are:
- **Facilitation**
    - Ensure the ceremonies are held and are productive
- **Impediment Removal**
    - Keep the path for the team clear so they can deliver great work
- **Coaching**
    - Help each member of the team reach their full potential

**Multiple Facets of Coaching**
|Tactical| Strategic|
|---|---|
It is provided by scrum master|It is provided by agile coach|
|Teaching scrum fundamentals|Helping each member embrace their role |
|Learning to be effective withing the framework|Watching for possible pitfalls|
| |Coaching at the organisational level|
|`This is like the player-coach who guides the teams' development and execution of the detailed plan` |`This is like head coach who sets the teams goal and creates a high-level plan for reaching them.`|

**When working with scrum, scrum master is treated as the `player-coach` for the team. A `player-coach` is a member of a team who simulataneously fills the role of both a player contributing to the end goal and the coach helping the team coordinate to reach their goal. It basically comes from sports, where a key player coaches the team from the field** 

**For successful COACH:**
* So to be successful coaching the team, you'll first need to get the team's permission to coach them.
* Confirm with them with what types of topics that they may like to consider for coaching.
* Focus on the problems that are important to the individuals and team itself
* Understand the team members strength and weaknesses

***Great coaches dont just help a team overcome their challenges.. they also help them build on their strengths.***


### 1.2 Assessing your team

***Before your can help your team progress, you first must understand where they are.***

**Comparative Agiliy: Agile assessment framework (www.comparativeagility.com)**
- Easily assessess your teams' alignment to agile value
- Leans towards the value and practises of the Scrum Framework
-   Identifies specific areas of imprevements for your team
-   Compares your team's agile maturity to other teams in similart industries

**Shu Ha Ri Concept**
Shu Ha Ri is a concept, originally from the martial arts, that describes the three phases of learning any skill from beginning to master.

*  **Shu**
    - It is a phase in which the student obeys the rules of a practice without question.
    - Student may not understand the underlining theories. 
- **Ha**
    - Iis a phase where students learn the theory  and detach from the rules
- **Ri**
    - It is a phase where student transcend the rules to write their own
    - Student are better bit to defie their own rule for better outcome

**Recognising Your Team's Level**
- Teams at the `lower level` tends to `overestimate` their skills.
- Teams at the `higher level` tends to `underestimate` their skills.

***Hence, agile assessments can provide an objective lens onto your teams TRUE SKILL LEVEL.***
### 1.3 Choosing the right metrics
No discussion of assessment would be completed, without discussing about its metrics. It can be very powerful tool for understanding how your team is progressing.

|Leading metrics| Lagging metrics|
|---|---|
|Known as leading indicators.|Known as Lagging indicators.|
| These are indicators that u can be measured when ativity is still in progress| This simply means you can capture the metrics after the activity that created the metric is finished.|
| For eg: the no of lines of code written per day. |For eg: the no of bugs in production is laggin. U can only count the bugs in production after the latest version has been released in the production env|
| |These are more reliable as it is based on actual measured data rather than projected data.|
| Downside: Less reliable since the link between collected metrics and possible outcome is based on extrapolation | Downside: By the time, these metrics are discovered, it is too late to avert any negative outcomes that u were trying to avoid.| 
**Why metrics become `less valuable` over time**
 - metrics are often only useful for a few sprints at a time 
 - the metric stabalises and yields no new information

***Remember that your goal as the `SCRUM MASTER` is to enable the team to do their best work. `Metric` should only be a mean to that goal not the end.***

## 2. Coaching Your Development Team

### 2.1 Starting your one-on-one on the right foot
-  One on one are more about building a relationship with your team. 
-  Without a foundation of open communication. the feedback necessary for successful coaching cant occur.
- Each one on one should last 30 mins
- focus on conversation not the format
- a simple format can keep the discussion format

**10-15-5 Format:**
- First 10 minutes review important items from the previous week and recent events
- Next 15 mins, discuss coaching topics or significant events
- Last 5 min, leave open as a buffer for overflow topics (extend the prior state of talk about future events)

**Never align two sessions back to back**
* This would create a space for buffer incase they run over
* Reduce collision
* Capture thoughts (time is available to capture thoughts about each sessions)

**What is scrum master journal**
* Record any observations about your teams' progress
* Perform a daily reflection (basically at the end of the day, +ve changes, what new did u do)
* Capture notes from your one-to-one.
### 2.2 Creating your coaching plan

One of the emost challenging aspects of a new coaching relationship is deciding what to work on.

**A coaching plan**

|Opprotunity|Current state| Desired state| Ideas|
|---|---|---|---|
|opportunity that u and yr team have, that u could accomplish through your coaching sessions|captures the current state of things regarding that opportunity|what would u like to be different as the result of the coaching|brainstorm ideas that will allow u to bring change that u desire

***Coaching is a purely two way conversation, especiailly for a new Scrum Master. Ask for the feedback about how you're serving the scrum master role.***
### 2.3 Coaching technical leads
* Situation can occur between the scrum master and the senior lead of the developement team who are new to scrum framework.
* A scrum master role's basis in servant leadership can create ambiguity about the team leadership.

### 2.4 Understanding dynamics of your team
* Every time a team's composition changes, the tram must learn to work together again.

**Tuckman's stage of group development**

* **Forming stage**
    * Here people get to know each other 
    * Every one tends to be polite
    * Confilt rerely occurs, as team works independently.
    * As a whole, team isnt productive

* **Storming stage**
    * Personality clashes emerges
    * Team member works beyound basic politeness, and start to become more candid with one another.
    * There will be argument an disagreement between the teams as boundaries are felt out.
    * After the boundaries are set in this stage, the team enters into the next stage called `norming stage`.
* **Norming stage**
    * Team takes advantage about the clear understanding that they have gained of one another and begin to collaborate more as a cohesive team.
* **Performing stage**
    * The team have truely define how they shall operate as cohesive team and have really gelled.
    * This is where, team peforms great. and better productive where everyone wants to be part of.

***Not all teams progress through all four stages. Many team gets stuck in the storming or norming stage. So there is no guarentee about the performing stage. Very importantly, Group developement is very sensitve to the dynamics that exists on the team. Changing a team member will affect its developement.***

***When new memeber joins, the team gets back to the very first `forming stage`***

***The tuckerman model is inteneded to make groups more aware of the effects of changing their composition. The teams who are more aware of their own dynamics can reach the `performing` stage more quickly.***

### 2.5 Coaching developers
* Scrum master one-on-ones should be a two-way coaching conversations 
* Action items that are specific are more likely to be successful than action items that are vague.

**Trigger**
A reminder to engage in a new routine or behaviour

**Designing Successful Triggers**

* **Tie to current habits**
    * Triggers are more successful when they are associated with something we already do.
* **Define a timebox**
    * Confining the new behaviour to a specific timebox makes it fell more manageable
 
## 3. Coaching Your Product Owner
### 3.1 Creating an envirnoment for coaching

**Challenges of coaching product Owners**
*  Product owner and scrum master often come from different areas of the organisation
* Scrum master usually have no direct experience with product ownership
* Product owners often hold a higher organisational rank than scrum master
* Coaching is a two-way relationship
* Create an environment that feels less like formal coaching and more like casual conversation
* Rather than formal conversation, setting up a stage for a coffee chat is rather better with `PRODUCT OWNER`

**Setting the stage for a `COFFEE CHAT`**
* Get out of the building
* Go to a casual environement
* Walk to the location
* Make it a regular occurrence

***Until trust is established, any attempts at coaching will be fruitless.***
    
### 3.2 Exploring the dynamics between the Scrum master and product owner
* Silence can be an useful tools for drawing further thoughts from someone.
* `Scrum teams have no leaders` (but it doesnt happen to all teams)
* Some team consider the poduct owner the first amomng equals.

**The Role of the scrum team**
* **Product Owner**
    * Choose the most valuable problem for the team to work on
* **Development Team**
  * Decide how the best solve the chosen problem
* **Scrum master**
    * Ensures everyone is ready to tackle the chosen problem.
### 3.3 Fostering productive conflict

**Productive conflict**
An open exchange of conflicting or different ideas in which parties fell equally heard.

|Unproductive Conflict|Productive Conflict|
|--|--|
|Focuses on individual rather than ideas. There is infact sense of dominancy by one party in a team.|Focuses on ideas to weight the metrics of each idea objectively|
|Associated with jokes, side remarks that dont contribute to the discussion.|It teaches us the conflit can be a healthy part of the team collaboration when fostered correctly|
|Discussion eventually begins to focus on individual involvement rather than the ideas of those individual.| |

**Making unproductive conflict PRODUCTIVE**
* **Use "I" language**
   * *We should state our concern using `"I"` language rather than `"YOU"`
    * `"YOU"` langague tends to blame to other parties, while `"I"` language shifts the focus from the person who has the concerns without explicitly blaming anyone.
* **Identify common goal**
   * We should identify our common goal. Most conflict arises not from a disagreement in goals, but rather from a disagreement in approaches as to how we should arrive at those goals. By realizing that both parties actually want the same thing, but only differ in how to get those things, most conflict gets much easier to manage
* **Listen reflectively**
    * Better understand each other's position, we should repeat them back to one another to ensure that they're not being misconstrued.
* **Resolution doesnt imply consensus**
    * Not all parties have to agree with the outcome for conflict to be resolved

***Productive conflict required a reasonable amount of trust to be successful.***
